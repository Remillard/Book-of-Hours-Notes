* Ongoing Notes on "Book of Hours"

The ~org-mode~ document in this repository named ~Book of Hours.org~ is my ongoing
notes in the Book of Hours game by Weather Factory.  It should not be considered
definitive or complete in any sense as it's just my record of things I've
discovered in the game as I go along.  It *is* pretty organized though, so feel
free to reference it if you like (though for those truly hungry for all the
answers should probably see the very complete Wiki.)

So, this document has minor to major spoilers, but probably not as many as if
you read the Wiki.  Be warned.
