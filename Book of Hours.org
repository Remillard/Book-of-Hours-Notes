* Basic Game Elements

** Principles of Soul

The Principles of Soul are the fundamental traits of everything in the game.
Every item, memory, card, etc will likely have one of these properties.  Books
will have challenges of these priciples to meet.  Visitors will be interested in
a certain amount of mystery about them.  There are 13 principles.

1. Edge
2. Forge
3. Grail
4. Heart
5. Knock
6. Lantern
7. Moon
8. Moth
9. Nectar
10. Rose
11. Scale
12. Sky
13. Winter

** Element of the Soul (Soul Cards)

Elements of the Soul in the form of soul cards are used to pay for tasks and
will be depleted on use to obtain the /Fatigued/ trait.  /Fatigue/ will be removed
at daybreak.  Soul cards are kept in the 2nd card tableau on the screen and may
come in base or upgraded varieties (marked with additional + signs.)

A soul card may also acquire a /Malady/ trait, most likely because a soul card was
used in a failed attempt to consider a book, or if the book is corrupted in some
form.  The quality that creates a malady will vary between elements and the
message received will describe what happened.  A soul card does not generally
attain a /Malady/ when used to pay for the initial book consideration.  Maladies
may be healed at beds, though not every bed may address every Element.

Elements of the Soul may be upgraded at crafting tables that matches the skill,
using a skill that matches the crafting table and has been attuned to them on
the Tree of Wisdom, and using two elements of the same strength.

See the [[*Element of Soul Card Table][Element of Soul Card Table]] in the appendix for details.

** Memories

Memories are created from most events.  Considering an household item with an
Element card will product a basic sensory memory.  The memory from considering
an item is constant and does not depend on the soul card used for the effort
(also true of reconsidering books).  Memory cards are kept in the 1st card
tableau on the screen (from the left).

Considering books with success will produce a memory for that book as well as
one or more lessons.  Failure to meet a book challenge will also produce a
memory (often Fear or Regret).  Reconsidering a book that has been mastered will
produce the same memory.

A memory is destroyed when it is used, at dawn in the case of non-persistent
memories, or at the end of the Numa season for all memories, persistant or not.

Memories are used for nearly everything.  An assistant may be spoken to about a
memory to gain its stats (only once per day).  Memories are used to attempt to
meet the requirements for a book element challenge.  Memories are used for
crafting (and so forth).

Specific memory types may be called for when entering the bonus round for
considering a book with not enough element to initially surpass the challenge.
In particular, weather is a known memory type that may be requested
specifically.

See the [[*Memory Table][Memory Table]] for details on the traits of known memories.

See the [[*Weather Table][Weather Table]] for details on the traits of weather memories.

*** Lessons

Lessons are special memories obtained by successfully considering books and
passing the relevant Soul Principle challenge.  The number of lessons gained
increases with the difficulty of the challenge.  They are considered a memory
with the additional tag of Persistent so they do not disappear at daybreak.
They WILL disappear at the end of a /Numa/ season.

Lessons are *only* generated the first time a book is mastered.  A lesson may be
considered to become a skill.  They may also used in upgrading skills and
evolving Elements.

See the [[*Book Table][Book Table]] for a listing of which lessons and other memories are
obtained from which books.  This may be cross-referenced with the [[*Memory Table][Memory Table]]
for properties of specific memories.

*** Seasons and Weather

**** Seasons

There are four normal seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter.  These cycle
as one would expect.  The next season begins when the vine on the time display
shows the final little V branching of the season vine at the very left side of
the display.  The season will update shortly after the weather generation step,
not at daybreak.  Any harvesting that starts in the period between daybreak and
the season switch continues at the season when the task originated.

Each season will only produce certain types of weather memories.

The season of /Numa/ is generated very infrequently, will last only a signle day,
and may be years between events.  The first time the /Numa/ season is generated, a
special topic of discussion is generated.  Additionally for the first and
subsequent /Numa/ seasons, a visitor will be generated.  The visitor will be
willing to discuss the /Numa/ special topic, however may be consulted for other
subjects if desired.

During /Numa/, there are special crafting reagents that may be obtained in the
gardens, and there may be other interesting results in crafting.

Beware!  At the end of /Numa/, all memories will be discarded, *including
persistent memories* like lessons and omens.  This effectively resets the memory
space and prevents lesson hoarding.

See the [[*Weather Table][Weather Table]] for information on which seasons may produce which weather
memories.

**** Weather

Weather is generated daily, not at sunrise, but shortly thereafter.  The card
generated is considered as a weather type and a memory type, thus weather is
relatively renewable and oftentimes has very high soul element memory type with
a variety of uses.  Which weather event is generated is random and season
dependent (more sunny days in summer, less in winter, etc.)

A weather card may be requested specifically when considering a book and failing
the element challenge and cycling through the bonus rounds.  (See section [[*Books][Books]]
for more details.)

Weather may be useful for boosting assistants as well as they will always talk
about the weather (however it will count as their memory boost and thus any
other memory type will not be valid.)

/Nume-Brume/ is a special weather event that happens only during the /Numa/ season.
It has extremely high stats for a weather memory, so may be useful for some
difficult challenges.

See the [[*Weather Table][Weather Table]] for full details on weather memory cards.

*** Circumstances

There are some status cards (like "Receding Waters") that are not memories
however exist in the Memory card tableau.

Circumstances are produced by some game events like pumping the water out of the
lower levels (and presumably others.)

Circumstances are destroyed in the season of /Numa/.
 
** Skills

Skills are obtained from considering lessons.  This will produce a permanent
skill card to be used for a variety of actions.  Skills are not depleted or
destroyed upon use.  Skills are kept in the 3rd card tableau at the bottom of
the screen.

Skills may be upgraded by considering the skill card.  This will require a soul
element that is related to the skill as well as a lesson with relevant soul
principles, and increasing amounts memories per level of upgrade to be
successful.

Skills are used for meeting book element challenges, crafting, and creating new
soul element cards for the player, as well as upgrading soul elements.

One particular and important use of skills relates to the Tree of Wisdom.  Each
skill initially has an affinity for two of the branches of the Tree of Wisdom.
Once placed into one of the branches, a new Element of Soul card is produced.
The Element of Soul produced is deterministic based on the Skill and the branch.
Once a skill is placed, it is permanently attuned to that branch and will lose
the other branch's property.  It may not be further applied to the Tree of
Wisdom even if raised to a higher level.

Particular crafting stations are used to upgrade soul element cards.  The
crafting station will have a property aligning it with a Tree of Wisdom branch,
as well as a number of principles of soul.  A skill that is associated with a
Tree of Wisdom branch AND has the particular principles for that station AND has
been attuned to the soul element may be used once to combine two soul elements
(also of that station's principles) into a single upgraded card.

See the [[*Tree of Wisdom][Tree of Wisdom]] section for details about the branches, and see the [[*Skills
Table][Skills Table]] for information about the known skills, stats, and
potential branch alignments and the element of soul cards produced..

** Collectible Items

Items may either be individual items obtained from Hush House, or collectible
item cards.  Individual items are things like books, tools, and plants that are
held in the inventory in the upper left corner of the game screen.  The
librarian may only hold five individual items at a time, and any event that
generates a sixth will cause the newest item to be placed outside of Hush House.
Collectible items are represented by cards and are held in the card tableau in
the lower right hand corner.

All individual items have soul principles to them.  Some items are destructable
(usually smaller items, candles, foodstuffs, beverages, crafting materials,
etc.)  The game will sometimes tells you when an item will be destroyed (during
a basic consideration, or talking to an assistant or visitor about the item),
however it may be assumed that in crafting it will be destroyed in the process.
The game will not warn you about destruction during crafting.  In particular,
note that the tea service in the opening room may be used to produce single
glasses of liquids *without* fully depleting the original bottle (though this is
not infinity -- the item title will start to show levels of the beverage).
Later in the kitchen, there is a serving cabinet that does the same thing.
Creating a glass of a beverage is a good way to add stats to an assistant as
they all will appreciate food or drink.

An item may be considered with a soul card and will produce a memory.

Many destructable items may be reacquired by purchasing them via post.

See the [[*Crafting Items Summary Table][Crafting Summary]] and [[*Craftable Items Tables][Craftable Items]] for information about craftable
individual items.

See [[*Miscellaneous Items][Miscellaneous Items]] for tables associated with many of the household
individual items in Hush House, including tools, plants, art and other objects
of interest.  Some of these may overlap with the craft

Collectible items cards are discussed further below while individual items of
note are further discussed in the [[*Inventory Items][Inventory Items]] section.

*** Currency

**** Money

Used for hiring laborers, buying items by post, etc.  Uses old British coin
system so a table of names and values is shown below.  When money is used to pay
for something, change will automatically be created.  The organize inventory
button may be used to combine money items into the least amount of cards
possible.

|---------------+--------|
| Name          | Amount |
|---------------+--------|
| Penny         | 1p     |
| Twopence      | 2p     |
| Threepence    | 3p     |
| Half-shilling | 6p     |
| Shilling      | 12p    |
| Florin        | 24p    |
| Half-crown    | 30p    |
| Crown         | 60p    |
| Pound         | 240p   |
|---------------+--------|

The librarian will start out with a small allowance from the Curia after
responding to the initial letter.  Thereafter another larger (but still limited)
allowance is granted each spring season.

Generally the largest use of money is hiring assistants from the bar.  The price
of that is 24p.  Given that the yearly stipend is one pound (240p) generally you
can count on opening about 10 rooms in a year after the first, if managed well.
Most of the initial rooms may be opened with the less expensive assistants in
the form of the the other houses in the village.

Money may also be used to order items from the two catalogs that comes to Hush
House shortly after opening it up.

Note, depending on the opening soul cards obtained at the beginning, it may be
necessary to hire an assistant to introduce to one of the other houses as it may
be impossible to use soul cards to pique their interest.

**** /Spintria/ & Tally

/Spintria/ is used for making wire, or buying books from the book seller event
that happens occasionally.  Also may be used to give to a visitor who knows a
language and can teach it.  A table of names and values is shown below.  The
price for a book or a service will be shown as the Tally property on a book.

/Spintria/ may be pared into smaller parts for making wire.  Much like money, if
/spintria/ is used to pay for something, they will make change appropriately.

|--------+---------|
| Name   | Amount  |
|--------+---------|
| Gold   | 5 tally |
| Silver | 4 tally |
| Tin    | 3 tally |
| Bronze | 2 tally |
| Iron   | 1 tally |
|--------+---------|

*** Assistants and Visitors

These 'people' item cards are obtained by either retaining the service of a town
helper (see [[*Brancrug Village][Brancrug Village]]) or by visitors in search of consultation or in
search of information about an ongoing event.

All people are candidates for the Talk function.

Assistants may be talked to about memories, weather, soul cards, and some items
or memories.  They will acquire the full value of the soul principles of these
items.  If a memory is used in this way it will be destroyed after talking.  If
an item is used it may or may not be destroyed, check the dialog to determine if
this will happen.  Note sometimes the notification is oblique such as "The
Coffinmaker will keep whatever remains of the wood." indicating it will be
destroyed in the process.  Items classified as Tools are almost always safe from
destruction, unless there is a special reason why they might not (the doll in
the infirmary is classified as a tool and single use).

Assistants are used to open rooms as the librarian is a weak person and may not
do physical labor apparently.  Boosting an assistant is vital to making the soul
principle check for opening a room.

Other visitors have a number of talk actions that may be useful.  It is
imperative to check the visitor card traits in detail to find out what they know
and what they are interested in.

- A visitor will often have an interest in the ongoing event.  The event card
  may be supplied as the topic of discussion.  During the talk, a book will be
  required as a solution to the discussion.  This book must have a mystery value
  greater than or equal to the visitor's interest in it.  The book does not have
  to be mastered.  Note that a visitor may be interested in two soul element
  topics however only *one* will be valid during the discussion about the event
  so pay attention to the dialog text before committing to the talk, because it
  *will not be repeated* once the conversation begins.  It may be useful to
  identify in advance whether a book exists for that visitor!

  A visitor may not be offered the same book twice as an answer to discussing an
  event.  The book will be given a property for that visitor when used.

  Upon succesful discussion about the event with a suitable book, the visitor
  will pay in /spintria/.
  
- A visitor may know a language that the player does not.  In this case, there
  should be no topic, and then in the following bin labeled "Give or Take" a
  /spintria/ card must be placed for payment, and the visitor will offer to
  teach the language.  Following the talk, a language skill card will be
  produced.  This card counts as a skill may be upgraded like other skills.
  
- No topic may be provided, at which it's considered a consultation and may
  produce a memory.

*** Events

Events are ongoing item cards that periodically will periodically cause a
visitor to arrive.  The first event will occur sometime in the first year.

The visitor may be talked to about the event upon which will desire a book that
matches their interest.  Generally a good idea to locate the book BEFORE
committing to talking to make sure it's understood which interest is at stake.

Upon talking to a visitor about an event, they will pay in /spintria/.

After several visitors have arrived to discuss the event, and have successfully
been presented with a book that meets their interest, the event will be redrawn
from the deck of events.

*** Letters

Initially the letter assigning the player character to Hush House is present.
If the librarian does not answer within a few seasons, a second letter will
follow asking why they haven't responded.  Responding to the letter requires a
desk and ink (which will be consumed).

Later, order forms are obtained to help order additional destructable items and
reagents for crafting.  When replying to order forms, it does not consume an ink
item, however responding to full letters seems to require an entire ink well.

Letters may be destroyed in a fireplace once no longer useful.

** Inventory Items

The inventory system consists of five locations in the upper left hand corner
that hold individual items from the environment.  If an action would cause a
sixth inventory item to be generated, excess will be left outside Hush House on
the ground.

Inventory items are much like card inventory however represent objects which may
be manipulated physically and placed in Hush House in appropriate places.

*** Books

Books are an item that shows up in rooms initially without identity.  Each book
must be considered with a soul card to catalogue it and discover the title.  It
does not seem to depend on the soul card what book is discovered (the soul card
is merely used to pay for the effort).  The color of the book does not appear to
have much relation to the book title (though may be related to the time period
in which the book was written.)

Following catalogue, a book will have several elements of note:

- Challenge: To obtain a lessons from the book, a soul principle challenge must
  be met while considering the book.  The number of lessons obtained varies with
  the difficulty of the challenge.  A memory will additionally be produced.
  - If the initial cards for the challenge does not satisfy the requirements,
    consideration will go through three "bonus rounds" during which other items
    may be requested to help meet the challenge.  Additional soul elements, and
    memories may be requested here, as well as occasionally a mood event
    generated (See the [[*Mood Table][Mood Table]] for details on what principles are covered with
    which moods.)  Wall art and weather are notable items that may be requested.
  - Failure to meet the challenge may cause a soul element card to gain the
    /Malady/ trait.  A different memory will be produced upon failure (typically
    thematic, like Regret or Fear).
  - Any Element card used in the challenge attempt will gain the /Fatigued/ trait
    for the rest of the day.
  - Any Memories used in the challenge attempt will be destroyed upon
    completion, whether successful or not.
  - If the book is corrupted, any Element cards used for the challenge may gain
    the /Malady/ trait, regardless of success or failure.
- Mastery: Once a book has been successfully considered, it may be reconsidered
  to obtain a memory.  This memory will be the same memory that was originally
  generated from the challenge consideration.  It will not produce a lesson and
  the challenge does not need to be met a second time, just paying for the
  effort with a soul card is sufficient.
- Subject: This is the lesson the book will teach.  There are more books than
  there are lessons, so multiple books address the same lesson.
- Language: This is an optional trait which will make it impossible to
  successfully master the book without knowing the language.  The player
  character knows a number of languages to begin with.  Others may be acquired
  (see [[*Assistants and Visitors][Assistants and Visitors]]).
- It is possible for a book to be a phonograph record, or film.  If this is
  true, the book may not be considered as usual, but instead use a projector or
  phonograph to master.
- It is possible for a book to be corrupted.  There are several forms of these
  corruptions and the corruption may be removed with sufficient soul elements
  and skill and memories.  If untreated, the corruption will cause maladies upon
  consideration of the book.  It may be possible for corruption to spread to
  other items nearby and corrupted books ought to be quarantined.

A book, once mastered, is mainly a source of memories, however may also be used
when visitors arrive to discuss events.  It is also fun to organize them by
whatever method suits the player.

Books may also be obtained periodically from an external source that will offer
to sell the book via mail order.  The price for the book will be in tally and
must be paid for with /spintria/.

See the [[*Book Table][Book Table]] for details about known books.

**** Journal

The Journal is a special book and the center of the Tree of Wisdom.  With
various inks, it may be added to.  The journal should likely be located in an
easy to find place for later reference.  There is an amusing comment in-game
that the journal location should be remembered because it's easy to get it lost.
There will be a LOT of books.

The stats on the Journal vary with the starting conditions of the game.

* Locations

** St Brandan's Cove

- This is the game's starting area and may not be returned to.  The librarian
  washes ashore and must consider the package in the inventory several times to
  recall an acquaintance's address.  Along the way the initial soul cards that
  will drive the opening state of the game and the initial Brancrug Village
  patron are determined.  Finally talk must be used to get a fisherman to come
  aid the librarian and open the path to the town.

** Brancrug Village

Brancrug Village is a small location adjacent to Hush House, used for
interacting with the outside world.

*** Zones

- Mr. & Mrs. Kille's House (Coffinmaker, and Midwife)
  - Provides two assistants depending on the soul card used: Mr. & Mrs. Kille.
- The Rectory
  - Provides the Rector assistant
- The "Sweet Bones"
  - The bar may be used to restore soul cards or hire helpers (see below on
    helpers.)
- Post Office
  - Used at the beginning to get the initial allowance.  May break money into
    subunits.  May mail letters.  Also apparently has a telegraph and telephone.
- The Smithy
  - Provides Denzil, the smith as an assistant.  Also may be used for breaking
    /spintria/ down into lower amounts (and different metal types).
- A Walk on the Moor
  - Special location for using heart, rose, or scale element, and same skill to
    discover items.  Usually grants a granite slab inventory item.

*** Assistants

- Assistants are obtained from the town in either the 3 starting house locations
  or the bar.
- The house the game starts will will provide an assistant for the price of
  talking with them with a relevant soul card (which will become /Fatigued/).
- The other two houses have assistants that may be obtained by interacting with
  them at their house with a relevant soul card (which will become /Fatigued/)
  and then providing 12p as a topic.
  - The other houses must be unlocked by an introduction or topic.  The starting
    assistant may introduce one, however a hired assistant may be required for
    the other.
- The bar will have a random passing assistant that may be discovered with any
  soul card (which will become /Fatigued/), and 1p. It doesn't actually consume
  the money, you're just flashing it around.
- Once the passing assistant is identified, they may be hired for 24p.
- Any assistant may be talked to with soul cards, memories or items to improve
  their soul principle stats by the amount that is on the added item.
  - Memories will be consumed in this manner.
  - Soul cards will become /Fatigued/.
  - An item is used as a topic of conversation, usually it means the item is
    destroyed, unless it is one of most tools or specifically says it will not
    be destroyed.
- Assistants have limitations on the items they may be interested in.
- Assistants are /usually/ the way to open rooms locations.
- Assistants will persist as a card but refuse to begin a task after dusk.  If
  the task is started before dusk, they will work to complete the task into the
  night.
- Assistants will go away at the next morning.
- An assistant may be only used actively once (this does not count Talking with
  them.)  If an assistant is used to open a room, the card will immediately
  vanish from the Items tab.  If an assistant is consulted about something and
  produces a memory, this will use up the assistant as well.

See the [[*Town Assistant Table][Town Assistants]] and [[*Hired Assistant Table][Hired Assistants]] tables for details on the assistant
hiring requirements and soul principle capabilities.

** Crowcross Sands

This area is unlocked by getting assistance for the Tidal Flats (2 moon or 2
winter) and contains two zones.

*** Zones

- Beachcombing
  - Used for finding items in the sea (notably the Hush House key if it's not in
    the gatehouse)
- Sea's Edge
  - Used for destroying items and swimming in the sea.
    
** Cucurbit Bridge

This area is unlocked by getting assistance for the Mist-Cloaked Bridge (1
forge, 1 lantern, or 1 sky) and has no further purpose than to traverse to the
Hush House Keeper's Lodge (likely part of the training on how to handle
assistants and opening locations.)

** Hush House

This is the primary game zone, filled with rooms that must be unlocked with
assistants.  Each room has may have inventory items that may be considered for
additional clues as to what they are and the history of Hush House.  Each room
may have books that may be considered to reveal memories, or skills.  Rooms may
also have crafting stations like desks, telescopes, and pretty much anything
else that offers multiple cards to insert to produce a result.

*** Opening rooms

Each room may only be opened by an assistant (except for the initial building
which requires the key, usually provided, though sometimes required to swim in
the ocean to find it.)  A room has a set of soul element requirements that must
be met by the assistant, who must have or acquire by boosting them via memories
or items.  There are some additional rooms that have unusual opening
requirements however they are rare and the requirements for them are denoted in
clues in the room text.

Room opening is effectively gated by money for hiring assistants, and suitable
soul cards, memories, and items to boost them.

*** Crafting Stations

Every crafting station may be attuned to a different set of soul elements, and
it has a level of challenge points (5, 10, 15) for the relevant craft.  Some
crafting areas are attuned to one of the Tree of Wisdom branches and may be used
to merge soul cards together into stronger single cards using a skill that will
work for the branch and the soul principles involved.

Crafting will tell you what the result is, and how to recreate it, however
requires starting to fill the craft slots to get this information.

*** Miscellaneous Notes

The following are a few clues in either book text, item text, or room
description that may become a relevant clue later.

- "When the Winter Tower was constructed (dedicated to the Madrugad), a new
  foundation poured and the Abbot mandated Stargall, not Yewgall, ink.  The Ink
  of Containment needed sky, not nectar."
- Reading Calicite Supplications - "One prayer describes how sufficient
  Grail-aspect can be used with Tridesma Hiera rites to give 'a life, a little
  life, a little little life' to a doll twisted from fabric…"
  - Clue to the little doll?


* Tree of Wisdom

The Tree of Wisdom is accessed via an icon next to the calendar on screen.  Each
point on an axis will become a location for a card.  Initially the journal is
placed in the center and will produce a soul card.

Each branch will unlock following the journal in the center.  A skill may be
placed in that location that must have one of the branch names as a trait.  When
a skill is assigned to a location, it becomes attuned to a skill that results.
See the [[*Skills Table][Skills Table]] for the list of skills and the soul cards that result from
particular wisdom locations.  These are deterministic.

Once a skill is assigned it may never be assigned again.  Additional progress
down a branch will require a skill with higher level so it is valuable to not
necessarily upgrade initial skills as that may use Lessons that could be used to
upgrade skills that may be used for progress.  (Leveling a skill may be
necessary to progress through greater soul elements, just use caution as Lessons
are a limited resource.)

The skill that is produced is shown with a + sign before "Accept" is pressed so
the player can adjust accordingly.

The nine branch names are (starting from top and moving clockwise):

1. Illumination
2. Hushery
3. Nyctodromy
4. Skolekosophy
5. Bosk
6. Preservation
7. Birdsong
8. Holomachistry
9. Ithastry

* Dramatis Personae

There are a number of historical personages discussed in the book or item texts.
Some of these may only be discovered by successfully considering an item.  Notes
on these people are collected below.

** St. Brandan's Abbey 

Not much known yet about the abbey, however there are a number of
abbots/abbesses of note as well as contemporaneous people mentioned.

- _Abbess Nonna_
  - Died by 'poisoning and Arts unsanctioned'
  - Monastery is reformed to accept only male novices.
- _Abbot Geffrey_
  - Gave sanctuary to Natan (a jewish man).
  - Built Barber's Tower in 15th century.
- _Abbot Thomas_
  - Early abbot before the Solar Gothic.
  - Liked to talk.
  - Originally a Viking mercenary named Toke and quartered at the abbey.
  - Eyes were pecked out after trying to loot.
  - Became the Abbot Thomas of the Abbey of the Black Dove.
  - Ship-brother Trygve
- _Natan_
  - A Jewish family that was granted asylum and lived in one of the abbey
    towers.
  - The patriarch of the family, Natan, was a physician and enhanced the medical
    care of the abbey.
- _Abbot Richard_
  - Called "Roaring Richard"
  - Wrote the book about local man and Icarus
  - Caused John Tregonwell to dissolve monastery
- _Sister Isabel_
  - Book commentary from /The Instruments of the Heart/
    - Sister Isabel, then Precentress of the Abbey-Church of St Brandan's,
      engages in dialogues with a Heart-long of a kind called 'duendrazon' that
      has taken partial possession of her body.
    - The duendrazon, like all its kind, usually dwells in the Mansus but can
      enter the physical world by manifesting as music, and take possession of a
      willing - or semi-willing - mortal who hears and loves that music… like
      Isabella.
    - Isabella records her dreams of the high Mansus, where she is accorded the
      duendrazon's status and titles. In return, the duendrazon enjoys what it
      calls 'caesura' - a welcome oblivion. 'Our mostly-blessing is that we may
      never cease - except /in caesurae/'. There is something more that Isabella
      refers to as the 'caesura magna', but she laments that her duendrazon will
      not tell her exactly what that might be.

** Barons & Baronesses

Hush House was created and built on baronial land and the aristocracy had a

3. _Walter Dewulf_

  - From the Dawn Period, before the Suppression Bureau, Curia, Dewulfs, and
    Sisters of the Knot.  100 generations ago.
- _Lady de Braose_
  - Known as the 1st Eva, never visited the island but endowed the Abbey in 13th
    century.  There are rumors why the widow of a Marcher lord took an interest
    in the abbey.  Widow of Marcher Lord Gwilym Ddu (Black William)
- _Lady Rowena_
  - Enigmatic Protectress with status by Henry Moore.  The artist spoke of a

** Element of Soul Card Table

Primary principles start at 2, and secondary principles start at 1.  When the
card is upgraded to *+*, *++*, and *+++* levels each principle increases by one.

Health is a little weird as both primaries start at 1 (for a total of 2), and
then the secondary upgrades slower.
